      "Some studies suggest that crying may have a relaxing effect on the body by releasing endorphins, a natural “feel-good” chemical in your body. Crying may also activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which helps your body recover from stress and trauma. It is always okay to cry, and if you need support, I am here for you.",
      "Several studies have shown that exercise releases endorphins and other chemicals that can help fight sadness. One study showed that participants who did moderate exercise over a 10-week period felt more energetic, positive, and calm than those who did not. In addition, the benefits of exercise were greater for people experiencing depressed mood. You don’t have to run a marathon or be a gym rat to see the benefits of exercise. Even light activities such as gardening and walking show a positive effect.",
      "If sadness has you feeling stressed out, the British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the “world’s most relaxing music” according to science. These songs include music by Enya, Airstream, Marconi Union, and Coldplay.",
      "Research has shown that physical warmth has a comforting effect. Taking a warm bath or a hot shower will help you relax. It may also help you soothe your feelings of sadness.",

      "By starting to breathe slowly, you will signal your brain to relax, as you slow down the release of adrenalin and cortisol, and increase the release of endorphins. You will also fully oxygenate your brain and body, allowing your heartbeat to slow and your blood pressure to stabilize.",
      "Some studies have shown that physical warmth is very soothing for many people and can help relieve stress. Taking a warm bath or a hot shower will help you relax."

    "anger":[
      "Exercise may also have a preventive effect. A Yale study suggested that prolonged bouts of running before an upsetting experience may dampen the extremity of your emotional reaction. Even if you can't take time for a full exercise routine when you're angry, try take a few moments.",
      "Breathing deeply from your diaphragm (the large muscle at the base of your lungs that assists with breathing) can help soothe feelings of anger. Deep, controlled breathing slows your heartbeat, stabilizes blood pressure, and relaxes your body. Combine your breathing exercise with a mantra, or calming word or phrase, for added benefit.",
      "Focused activities may help channel your angry energy into a productive expression so that you can move past your immediate feelings of anger. Research has shown that anger can even temporarily enhance brainstorming and creative thinking. Engage your imagination and mindfully release your anger in a controlled, creative way"
