    "An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple.",
    "It is often served with whipped cream, ice cream (\"apple pie \u00e0 la mode\"), or cheddar cheese.",
    "English apple pie recipes go back to the time of Chaucer. The 1381 recipe is the earliest known apple pie recipe in the world, and lists the ingredients as good apples, good spices, figs, raisins and pears.",
    "It wasn't until the 15th century that Dutch bakers transformed the crust-less apple pie into the lattice-style pastry we commonly see today.",
    "The apple pie had to wait for the planting of European varieties, brought across the Atlantic, to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities as there were no native apples except crabapples, which yield very small and sour fruit. That happened during the 17th and 18th centuries when the British, Dutch, and Swedes brought some apple varieties good for pies.",
    "There are American apple pie recipes, both manuscript and printed, from the 18th century, and it has since become a very popular dessert.",
    "America's first cookbook, American Cookery, includes two recipes for apple pie, neither claiming the roots of the recipe.",
    "Today, apple pie is the most popular flavor in America, followed by pumpkin, chocolate, lemon meringue and cherry \u2013 according to the American Pie Council.",
    "The saying \"as American as apple pie\" describes things that represent the best of American culture. People use this expression when talking about things like blue jeans, baseball and rock-n-roll music.",
    "The primary origins of \"as American as apple pie\" are difficult to pinpoint, but it was used as early as 1928 to describe the home-making abilities of Lou Henry Hoover (President Herbert Hoover's wife). The next result we could dig up, a Times article in which the phrase is enlisted to describe lynchings, comes nearly a decade later. It is fair to assert that though the phrase was floating around in the early 20th century, it was seldomly used.",
    "It wasn't until the 1940s, when the United States entered World War II, that \"as American as apple pie\" truly took off. When journalists at the time asked soldiers why they were willing to fight in the war, the typical response was \"for mom and apple pie.\" By the 1960s, the phrase transformed into \"American as apple pie.\""

    "Meanwhile, Louis XIV was so passionate about it that he insisted that every meal be finished with jams served in special ornate silver dishes. All of his was made from the fruit gardens at Versailles \u2013 and as they included tropical varieties like pineapple there must have been some interesting flavours indeed.",
    "Although the immigrants to the US brought their own recipes with them, the first book on making jam appeared in this country in the 17th century. Early settlers in New England used other ways of making jam, using molasses, honey and maple sugar to give it the sweet taste. They used pectin obtained from boiling apple peel to use as the thickening agent."
